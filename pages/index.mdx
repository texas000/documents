## Our Tech Stack

Here's a breakdown of the technologies we're using to bring this e-commerce platform to life:

### Frontend

* **Next.js:** We're leveraging **Next.js** for its powerful features like **server-side rendering (SSR)** and **static site generation (SSG)**. These are crucial for optimizing performance, improving search engine visibility, and building a highly scalable and resilient frontend. Its integrated file-system-based routing and API routes also streamline development.
* **React.js:** As the core library for our user interfaces, **React.js** allows us to build complex, interactive components. This component-based approach promotes reusability and makes the codebase easier to maintain.
* **TypeScript:** To ensure code quality, catch errors early, and improve maintainability, we're strictly using **TypeScript** across the entire frontend codebase.
* **Tailwind CSS:** For efficient and highly customizable styling, we rely on **Tailwind CSS**. Its utility-first approach enables rapid UI development and consistent design across the application.

### Backend & Services

* **Microservices Architecture:** The application is built on a **microservices architecture**. This approach lets us develop, deploy, and scale individual services independently, increasing agility and resilience. Each service is designed to handle a specific business capability, such as user authentication, product catalog management, order processing, or payment gateway integration.
* **Node.js (with Express.js/Fastify):** Many of our microservices are developed using **Node.js**, often paired with frameworks like **Express.js** or **Fastify**. Their asynchronous, event-driven nature is ideal for building high-performance network applications that can handle a large number of concurrent requests.
* **Java (with Spring Boot):** For certain critical or data-intensive services, we leverage **Java with Spring Boot**. This provides a robust ecosystem, strong typing, and enterprise-grade capabilities for complex business logic.
* **Coveo:** We integrate with **Coveo** for intelligent search, personalized recommendations, and content personalization. Coveo's AI-powered relevance platform is crucial for helping users efficiently find products and information, delivering a tailored experience based on their behavior and context.
* **Kafka:** For asynchronous communication between our microservices and for real-time data streaming, we use **Apache Kafka**. This ensures high throughput and fault tolerance for critical events like new orders or inventory updates.
* **Redis:** We employ **Redis** for caching frequently accessed data and managing user session states. This significantly improves application responsiveness and reduces the load on our primary databases.

### Databases

* **PostgreSQL:** Our primary relational database is **PostgreSQL**, chosen for its reliability, data integrity, and robust support for complex queries on structured data.
* **MongoDB:** For flexible and scalable storage of unstructured or semi-structured data, **MongoDB** is invaluable. It's particularly useful for dynamic product catalogs with varying attributes or for handling user-generated content.
* **Elasticsearch:** Integrated with Coveo, **Elasticsearch** provides powerful full-text search capabilities and analytics on large datasets, facilitating rapid and highly relevant search results.

### Cloud & DevOps

* **Kubernetes:** For orchestrating containers and automating the deployment, scaling, and management of our microservices, we utilize **Kubernetes**.
* **Docker:** We use **Docker** for containerizing our applications, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.
* **CI/CD Pipelines (e.g., GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins):** Automated continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines are essential for rapid iteration, thorough testing, and efficient delivery of new features and updates.
* **Prometheus & Grafana:** For comprehensive monitoring of our application and infrastructure health and performance, we rely on **Prometheus** for data collection and **Grafana** for visualization. This allows us to proactively detect and resolve issues.
* **Terraform:** For infrastructure as code, **Terraform** enables us to provision and manage our cloud resources efficiently and repeatably, ensuring consistency and version control for our infrastructure.
